# Interruptions
Interruptions mechanism for handling asynchronous events or signals, typically called interrupts. Interrupts can stop the main program from executing to perform a separate interrupt service routine (ISR)

To access pins and registers to control pins use `<avr/interrupt.h>` library.


## Enabling/Disabling interruptions
Before using interruptions, interruptions should be enabled in `SREG`â€“ AVR Status Register (bit 8). 
It's possible to set bit manually (for example `SREG |= 1 << 7;`), but it's more preferred to use next functions:
- `sei();` - enable interruptions
- `cli();` - disable interruptions

**Use infinite loop!!!**

Interrupts may not work as expected if there is no infinite loop or a mechanism to keep the microcontroller running in your program. So even if program doesn't need to have infinite loop, it should be present in order to allow interruptions to work `while (1);`.
