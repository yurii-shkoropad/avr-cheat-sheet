# Capacitor
A Capacitor is a passive component that has the ability to store the energy in the form of potential difference between its plates.

## Polarized capacitor
A polarized capacitor is a type of capacitor that has a specific polarity or direction in which it must be connected in a circuit. Electrolytic capacitors are polarized capacitors.

## Non-Polarized capacitor
Non-polarized capacitors are capacitors that do not have a specific polarity; in other words, they can be connected to a circuit in either direction. Unlike polarized capacitors, non-polarized capacitors do not have a positive and a negative lead.

## Smoothing capacitor
A smoothing capacitor, also known as a filter capacitor or reservoir capacitor, is a type of capacitor commonly used in electronic circuits, especially in power supply circuits. Its primary function is to reduce or eliminate the ripple voltage in a DC power supply.

In a rectifier circuit, AC voltage is converted to DC voltage. However, due to the nature of the rectification process, the resulting DC voltage may have some variations or ripples. A smoothing capacitor is introduced in the circuit to smooth out these ripples and produce a more stable DC voltage.
