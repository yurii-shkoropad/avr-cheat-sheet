# 1-Wire
The 1-Wire protocol is a low-speed, serial communication protocol that allows devices to communicate with a microcontroller or computer using only one data line and ground. It's often used in applications where low-speed communication and minimal wiring are essential, such as in temperature sensors, memory devices, and other integrated circuits.
